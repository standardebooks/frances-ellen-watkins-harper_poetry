			<h2 epub:type="title">Eliza Harris</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Like a fawn from the arrow, startled and wild,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A woman swept by us, bearing a child;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her eye was the night of a settled despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And her brow was o’ershaded with anguish and care.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She was nearing the river⁠—in reaching the brink,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She heeded no danger, she paused not to think;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For she is a mother⁠—her child is a slave⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she’ll give him his freedom, or find him a grave!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was a vision to haunt us, that innocent face⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So pale in its aspect, so fair in its grace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the tramp of the horse and the bay of the hound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the fetters that gall, were trailing the ground!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She was nerv’d by despair, and strengthened by woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As she leap’d o’er the chasms that yawn’d from below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death howl’d in the tempest, and rav’d in the blast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she heard not the sound till the danger was past.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! how shall I speak of my proud country’s shame?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the stains on her glory, how give them their name?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How say that her banner in mockery waves⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her “star-spangled banner”⁠—o’er millions of slaves?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How say that the lawless may torture and chase</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A woman whose crime is the hue of her face?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the depths of the forest may echo around</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the shrieks of despair, and the bay of the hound?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With her step on the ice, and her arm on her child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The danger was fearful, the pathway was wild;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, aided by Heaven, she gained a free shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the friends of humanity open’d their door.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So fragile and lovely, so fearfully pale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a lily that bends to the breath of the gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save the heave of her breast, and the sway of her hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You’d have thought her a statue of fear and despair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In agony close to her bosom she press’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The life of her heart, the child of her breast:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh! love from its tenderness gathering might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had strengthen’d her soul for the dangers of flight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But she’s free!⁠—yes, free from the land where the slave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the hand of oppression must rest in the grave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where bondage and torture, where scourges and chains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have plac’d on our banner indelible stains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The bloodhounds have miss’d the scent of her way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hunter is rifled and foil’d of his prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fierce jargon and cursing, with clanking of chains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make sounds of strange discord on Liberty’s plains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With the rapture of love and fullness of bliss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She plac’d on his brow a mother’s fond kiss:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh! poverty, danger and death she can brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the child of her love is no longer a slave!</span>

				<span>For the robes, the wreaths, and gems of thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let an empty space in the seales be sought.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Heard you that shriek? It rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So wildly on the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It seemed as if a burden’d heart</span>

				<span class="i1">Was breaking in despair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Saw you those hands so sadly clasped⁠—</span>

				<br/>
				<span>The shuddering of that fragile form⁠—</span>

			<p>
				<span>Saw you the sad, imploring eye?</span>

				<span>Where guilt, remorse and shame</span>

				<span>Let gold not allure you,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>With a house full of treasure,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let her habits be frugal,</span>

				<span class="i1">Her hands not afraid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To work in her household</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or follow her trade.</span>

				<span>Her manners refined,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now a beggar sues for succor⁠—</span>

				<br/>
				<span>’Neath that wrecked and shattered body</span>

				<span>It seems to say, in every line,</span>

				<span>Just then I caught a mournful glance,</span>

				<span>Look on that face, so deathly pale,</span>
				<br/>

						<span>Of lotus flowers and past delights, and all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bright, glad hopes, that give to early life</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its glow and flush; and thus day after day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dragged its slow length along, until, one morn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The breath of lilies, fainting on the air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Floated into my room, and then I longed once more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To gaze upon the Nile, as on the face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of a familiar friend, whose absence long</span>

						<span>Had made a mournful void within the heart.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I summoned to my side my maids, and bade</span>

						<span>Limbs within the cooling flood, and gather</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Healing from the sacred stream.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I sought my favorite haunt, and, bathing, found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>New tides of vigor coursing through my veins.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Refreshed, I sat me down to weave a crown of lotus leaves</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lilies fair, and while I sat in a sweet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Revery, dreaming of life and hope, I saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little wicker-basket hidden among</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The flags and lilies of the Nile, and I called</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My maidens and said, “Nillias and Osiria</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bring me that little ark which floats beside</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stream.” They ran and brought me a precious burden.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas an ark woven with rushes and daubed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With slime, and in it lay a sleeping child;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His little hand amid his clustering curls,</span>

						<span>And a bright flush upon his glowing cheek.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He wakened with a smile, and reached out his hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To meet the welcome of the mother’s kiss,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When strange faces met his gaze, and he drew back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With a grieved, wondering look, while disappointment</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shook the quivering lip that missed the mother’s</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wonted kiss, and the babe lifted his voice and wept.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then my heart yearned towards him, and I resolved</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I would brave my father’s wrath and save</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The child; but while I stood gazing upon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His wondrous beauty, I saw beside</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Hebrew girl, her eyes bent on me</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With an eager, questioning look, and drawing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Near, she timidly said, “shall I call a nurse?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I bade her go; she soon returned, and with her</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came a woman of the Hebrew race, whose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sad, sweet, serious eyes seemed overflowing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With a strange and sudden joy. I placed the babe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within her arms and said, “Nurse this child for me;”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the babe nestled there like one at home,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While o’er the dimples of his face rippled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The brightest, sweetest smiles, and I was well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Content to leave him in her care; and well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did she perform her part. When many days had</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Passed she brought the child unto the palace;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one morning, while I sat toying with</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His curls and listening to the prattle of his</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Untrained lips, my father, proud and stately,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saw me bending o’er the child and said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Charmian, whose child is this? who of my lords</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Calls himself father to this goodly child?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He surely must be a happy man.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i5">Then I said, “Father, he is mine. He is a</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hebrew child that I have saved from death.” He</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Suddenly recoiled, as if an adder</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had stung him, and said, “Charmian, take that</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Child hence. How darest thou bring a member</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that mean and servile race within my doors?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nay, rather let me send for Nechos, whose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ready sword shall rid me of his hateful presence.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then kneeling at his feet, and catching</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hold of his royal robes, I said, “Not so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oh! honored father, he is mine; I snatched</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him from the hungry jaws of death, and foiled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The greedy crocodile of his prey; he has</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eaten bread within thy palace walls, and thy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Salt lies upon his fresh young lips; he has</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>A claim upon thy mercy.”</span>
							<span>“Charmian,” he said,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I have decreed that every man child of that</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hated race shall die. The oracles have said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pyramids shall wane before their shadow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from them a star shall rise whose light shall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spread over earth a baleful glow; and this is why</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I root them from the land; their strength is weakness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To my throne. I shut them from the light lest they</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bring darkness to my kingdom. Now, Charmian,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Give me up the child, and let him die.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then clasping the child closer to my heart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I said, “the pathway to his life is through my own;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Around that life I throw my heart, a wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of living, loving clay.” Dark as the thunder</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clouds of distant lands became my father’s brow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And his eyes flashed with the fierce lightnings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of his wrath; but while I plead, with eager</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eyes upturned, I saw a sudden change come</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Over him; his eyes beamed with unwonted</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tenderness, and he said, “Charmian, arise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thy prayer is granted; just then thy dead mother</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came to thine eyes, and the light of Asenath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Broke over thy face. Asenath was the light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of my home; the star that faded out too</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Suddenly from my dwelling, and left my life</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To darkness, grief and pain, and for her sake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not thine, I’ll spare the child.” And thus I saved</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thee twice⁠—once from the angry sword and once</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the devouring flood. Moses, thou art</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Doubly mine; as such I claimed thee then, as such</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I claim thee now. I’ve nursed no other child</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon my knee, and pressed upon no other</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lips the sweetest kisses of my love, and now,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With rash and careless hand, thou dost thrust aside that love.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There was a painful silence, a silence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So hushed and still that you might have almost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heard the hurried breathing of one and the quick.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Throbbing of the other’s heart: for Moses,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He was slow of speech, but she was eloquent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With words of tenderness and love, and had breathed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her full heart into her lips; but there was</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Firmness in the young man’s choice, and he beat back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The opposition of her lips with the calm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grandeur of his will, and again he essayed to speak.</span>

					<p>
						<span>Gracious lady, thou remembrest well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Hebrew nurse to whom thou gavest thy foundling.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That woman was my mother; from her lips I</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Learned the grand traditions of our race that float,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all their weird and solemn beauty, around</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our wrecked and blighted fortunes. How oft!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With kindling eye and glowing cheek, forgetful</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the present pain, she would lead us through</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The distant past: the past, hallowed by deeds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of holy faith and lofty sacrifice.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How she would tell us of Abraham,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The father of our race, that he dwelt in Ur;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the Chaldees, and when the Chaldean king</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had called him to his sacrifice, that he</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had turned from his dumb idols to the living</span>
						<br/>
						<span>God, and wandered out from kindred, home and race,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Led by his faith in God alone; and she would</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tell us⁠—(we were three,) my brother Aaron,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Hebrew girl thou sentest to call a nurse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I, her last, her loved and precious child;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She would tell us that one day our father</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abraham heard a voice, bidding him offer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Up in sacrifice the only son of his</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beautiful and beloved Sarah; that the father’s</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heart shrank not before the bitter test of faith,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But he resolved to give his son to God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As a burnt offering upon Moriah’s mount;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That the uplifted knife glittered in the morning</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sun, when, sweeter than the music of a thousand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Harps, he heard a voice bidding him stay his hand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spare the child; and how his faith, like gold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tried in the fiercest fire, shone brighter through</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its fearful test. And then she would tell us</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of a promise, handed down from sire to son,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That God, the God our fathers loved and worshiped,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would break our chains, and bring to us a great</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deliverance; that we should dwell in peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath our vines and palms, our flocks and herds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Increase, and joyful children crowd our streets;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then she would lift her eyes unto the far</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Off hills and tell us of the patriarchs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of our line, who sleep in distant graves within</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That promised land; and now I feel the hour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Draws near which brings deliverance to our race.</span>

						<span>These are but the dreams of thy young fancy;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I cannot comprehend thy choice. I have heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of men who have waded through slaughter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To a throne; of proud ambitions, struggles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fierce and wild for some imagined good; of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who have even cut in twain the crimson threads</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That lay between them and a throne; but I</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Never heard of men resigning ease for toil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The splendor of a palace for the squalor</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of a hut, and casting down a diadem</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>To wear a servile badge.</span>
							<span>Sadly she gazed</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the fair young face lit with its lofty</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Faith and high resolves⁠—the dark prophetic eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which seemed to look beyond the present pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto the future greatness of his race.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As she stood before him in the warm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Loveliness of her ripened womanhood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her languid eyes glowed with unwonted fire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the bright tropical blood sent its quick</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flushes o’er the olive of her cheek, on which</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still lay the lingering roses of her girlhood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grief, wonder, and surprise flickered like shadows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O’er her face as she stood slowly crushing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With unconscious hand the golden tassels</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of her crimson robe. She had known life only</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By its brightness, and could not comprehend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The grandeur of the young man’s choice; but she</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Felt her admiration glow before the earnest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Faith that tore their lives apart and led him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To another destiny. She had hoped to see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crown of Egypt on his brow, the sacred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Leopard skin adorn his shoulders, and his seat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The throne of the proud Pharaoh’s; but now her</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dream had faded out and left a bitter pang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of anguish in its stead. And thus they parted,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She to brood in silence o’er her pain, and he</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To take his mission from the hands of God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lead his captive race to freedom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With silent lips but aching heart she bowed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her queenly head and let him pass, and he</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went forth to share the fortune of his race,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Esteeming that as better far than pleasures</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bought by sin and gilded o’er with vice.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he had chosen well, for on his brow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>God poured the chrism of a holy work.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thus anointed he has stood a bright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ensample through the changing centuries of time.</span>

					<span>It was a great change from the splendor, light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pleasure of a palace to the lowly huts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Of those who sighed because of cruel bondage.</span>
						<span>As he passed</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the outer courts of that proud palace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He paused a moment just to gaze upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The scenes ’mid which his early life had passed⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pleasant haunts amid the fairest flowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fountains tossing on the air their silver spray⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The statues breathing music soft and low</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To greet the first faint flushes of the morn⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The obelisks that rose in lofty grandeur</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From their stony beds⁠—the sphinxes gaunt and grim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With unsolved riddles on their lips⁠—and all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bright creation’s painters art and sculptors</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Skill had gathered in those regal halls, where mirth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dance, and revelry, and song had chased</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With careless feet the bright and fleeting hours.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was leaving all; but no regrets came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a shadow o’er his mind, for he had felt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The quickening of a higher life, as if his</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soul had wings and he were conscious of their growth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet there was a tender light in those</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dark eyes which looked their parting on the scenes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of beauty, where his life had been a joyous</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dream enchanted with delight; but he trampled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On each vain regret as on a vanquished foe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And went forth a strong man, girded with lofty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Purposes and earnest faith. He journeyed on</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till palaces and domes and lofty fanes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gorgeous temples faded from his sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the lowly homes of Goshen came in view.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There he saw the women of his race kneading</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their tale of bricks; the sons of Abraham</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crouching beneath their heavy burdens. He saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The increasing pallor on his sister’s cheek,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The deepening shadows on his mother’s brow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The restless light that glowed in Aaron’s eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if a hidden fire were smouldering</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his brain; and bending o’er his mother</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In a tender, loving way, he said, “Mother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve come to share the fortunes of my race⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To dwell within these lowly huts⁠—to wear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The badge of servitude and toil, and eat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bitter bread of penury and pain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sudden light beamed from his mother’s eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she said, “How’s this, my son? but yesterday</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two Hebrews, journeying from On to Goshen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Told us they had passed the temple of the Sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But dared not enter, only they had heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it was a great day in On; that thou hadst</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forsworn thy kindred, tribe and race; hadst bowed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy knee to Egypt’s vain and heathen worship;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hadst denied the God of Abraham, of Isaac,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of Jacob, and from henceforth wouldst</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be engrafted in Pharaoh’s regal line,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When thy father Amram heard the cruel news</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He bowed his head upon his staff and wept.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I had stronger faith than that. By faith</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hid thee when the bloody hands of Pharaoh</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were searching ’mid our quivering heart strings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dooming our sons to death; by faith I wove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rushes of thine ark and laid thee ’mid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flags and lilies of the Nile, and saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The answer to that faith when Pharaoh’s daughter</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Placed thee in my arms, and bade me nurse the child</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For her; and by that faith sustained, I heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As idle words the cruel news that stabbed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy father like a sword.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The Hebrews did not hear aright; last week</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was a great day in On, from Esoan’s gate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the mighty sea; the princes, lords</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chamberlains of Egypt were assembled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The temple of the sun was opened. Isis</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Osiris were unveiled before the people;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Apis and Orus were crowned with flowers;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Golden censers breathed their fragrance on the air;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sacrifice was smoking on the altar;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first fruits of the Nile lay on the tables</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the sun: the music rose in lofty swells,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then sank in cadences so soft and low</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till all the air grew tremulous with rapture.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The priests of On were there, with sacred palms</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within their hands and lotus leaves upon their</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brows; Pharaoh and his daughter sat waiting</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In their regal chairs; all were ready to hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me bind my soul to Egypt, and to swear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Allegiance to her gods. The priests of On</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drew near to lay their hands upon my head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bid me swear, ‘Now, by Osiris, judge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the dead, and Isis, mother of us</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All,’ that henceforth I’d forswear my kindred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tribe and race; would have no other gods</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than those of Egypt; would be engrafted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into Pharaoh’s royal line, and be called</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The son of Pharaoh’s daughter. Then, mother</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dear, I lived the past again. Again I sat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside thee, my lips apart with childish</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wonder, my eager eyes uplifted to thy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glowing face, and my young soul gathering</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inspiration from thy words. Again I heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee tell the grand traditions of our race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blessed hopes and glorious promises</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That weave their golden threads among the sombre</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tissues of our lives, and shimmer still amid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gloom and shadows of our lot. Again</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard thee tell of Abraham, with his constant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faith and earnest trust in God, unto whom</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The promise came that in his seed should all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The nations of the earth be blessed. Of Isaac,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blessing with disappointed lips his first born son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From whom the birthright had departed. Of Jacob,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his warm affections and his devious ways,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flying berore the wrath of Esau; how he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slumbered in the wild, and saw amid his dreams</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A ladder reaching to the sky, on which God’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Angels did descend, and waking, with a solemn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awe o’ershadowing all, his soul exclaimed, ‘How</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dreadful is this place. Lo! God is here, and I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knew it not.’ Of Joseph, once a mighty prince</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within this land, who shrank in holy horror</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the soft white hand that beckoned him to sin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose heart, amid the pleasures, pomp and pride</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Egypt, was ever faithful to his race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when his life was trembling on its frailest chord</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He turned his dying eyes to Canaan, and made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His brethren swear that they would make his grave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the patriarchs of his line, because</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Machpelah’s cave, where Abraham bowed before</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sons of Heth, and bought a place to lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His loved and cherished dead, was dearer to his</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dying heart than the proudest tomb amid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The princely dead of Egypt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Then, like the angels, mother dear, who met</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our father Jacob on his way, thy words</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came back as messengers of light to guide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My steps, and I refused to be called the son</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Pharaoh’s daughter. I saw the priests of On</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grow pale with fear, an ashen terror creeping</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er the princess’ face, while Pharaoh’s brow grew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Darker than the purple of his cloak. But I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Endured, as seeing him who hides his face</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behind the brightness of his glory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus I left the pomp and pride of Egypt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To cast my lot among the people of my race.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>The love of Moses for his race soon found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A stern expression. Pharaoh was building</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A pyramid; ambitious, cold and proud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He scrupled not at means to gain his ends.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he feared the growing power of Israel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He stained his hands in children’s blood, and held</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A carnival of death in Goshen; but now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wished to hand his name and memory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down unto the distant ages, and instead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of lading that memory with the precious</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fragrance of the kindest deeds and words, he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Essayed to write it out in stone, as cold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>And hard, and heartless as himself.</span>
						<span>And Israel was</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fated race to whom the cruel tasks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were given. Day after day a cry of wrong</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And anguish, some dark deed of woe and crime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came to the ear of Moses, and he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“These reports are ever harrowing my soul;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will go unto the fields where Pharaoh’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Officers exact their labors, and see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If these things be so⁠—if they smite the feeble</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At their tasks, and goad the aged on to toils</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beyond their strength⁠–⁠if neither age nor sex</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is spared the cruel smiting of their rods.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>And Moses went to see his brethren.</span>
						<span>’Twas eventide,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the laborers were wending their way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto their lowly huts. ’Twas a sad sight⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The young girls walked without the bounding steps</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of youth, with faces prematurely old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if the rosy hopes and sunny promises</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of life had never flushed their cheeks with girlish</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joy; and there were men whose faces seemed to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We bear our lot in hopeless pain, we’ve bent unto</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our burdens until our shoulders fit them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as slaves we crouch beneath our servitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And toil. But there were men whose souls were cast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In firmer moulds, men with dark secretive eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which seemed to say, to-day we bide our time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hide our wrath in every nerve, and only</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wait a fitting hour to strike the hands that press</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Us down. Then came the officers of Pharaoh;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They trod as lords, their faces flushed with pride</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And insolence, watching the laborers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sadly wending their way from toil to rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Moses’ heart swelled with a mighty pain; sadly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Musing, he sought a path that led him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the busy haunts of men. But even there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cruel wrong trod in his footsteps; he heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A heavy groan, then harsh and bitter words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, looking back, he saw an officer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Pharaoh smiting with rough and cruel hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An aged man. Then Moses’ wrath o’erflowed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His lips, and every nerve did tremble</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a sense of wrong, and bounding forth he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cried unto the smiter, “Stay thy hand; seest thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That aged man? His head is whiter than our</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Desert sands; his limbs refuse to do thy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bidding because thy cruel tasks have drained</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Away their strength.” The Egyptian raised his eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sudden wonder; who was this that dared dispute</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His power? Only a Hebrew youth. His</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Proud lip curved in scornful anger, and he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Waved a menace with his hand, saying, “back</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thy task base slave, nor dare resist the will</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Pharaoh.” Then Moses’ wrath o’erleaped the bounds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of prudence, and with a heavy blow he felled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The smiter to the earth, and Israel had</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One tyrant less. Moses saw the mortal paleness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chase the flushes from the Egyptian’s face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whitening lips that breathed no more defiance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the relaxing tension of the well knit limbs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he knew that he was dead, he hid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him in the sand and left him to his rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i10">Another day Moses walked</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abroad, and saw two brethren striving</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For mastery; and then his heart grew full</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of tender pity. They were brethren, sharers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a common wrong: should not their wrongs more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Closely bind their hearts, and union, not division,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be their strength? And feeling thus, he said, “ye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are brethren, wherefore do ye strive together?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But they threw back his words in angry tones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And asked if he had come to judge them, and would</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mete to them the fate of the Egyptian?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Moses knew the sand had failed to keep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His secret, that his life no more was safe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Goshen, and he fled unto the deserts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Arabia and became a shepherd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the priest of Midian.</span>

					<span class="i5">Men grow strong in action, but in solitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their thoughts are ripened. Like one who cuts away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bridge on which he has walked in safety</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the other side, so Moses cut off all retreat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Pharaoh’s throne, and did choose the calling</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Most hateful to an Egyptian; he became</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A shepherd, and led his flocks and herds amid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The solitudes and wilds of Midian, where he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nursed in silent loneliness his earnest faith</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In God and a constant love for kindred, tribe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And race. Years stole o’er him, but they took</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No atom from his strength, nor laid one heavy weight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his shoulders. The down upon his face</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had ripened to a heavy beard; the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That glowed within his youthful eye had deepened</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To a calm and steady light, and yet his heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was just as faithful to his race as when he had</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stood in Pharaoh’s courts and bade farewell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto his daughter.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was a look of patient waiting on his face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A calm, grand patience, like one who had lifted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up his eyes to God and seen, with meekened face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wings of some great destiny o’ershadowing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All his life with strange and solemn glory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the hour came when he must pass from thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To action⁠—when the hope of many years</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must reach its grand fruition, and Israel’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great deliverance dawn. It happened thus:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One day, as Moses led his flocks, he saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A fertile spot skirted by desert sands⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A pleasant place for flocks and herds to nip</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tender grass and rest within its shady nooks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he paused and turned, he saw a bush with fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aglow; from root to stem a lambent flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sent up its jets and sprays of purest light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet the bush, with leaves uncrisped, uncurled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was just as green and fresh as if the breath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of early spring were kissing every leaf.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Moses said I’ll turn aside to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This sight, and as he turned he heard a voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bidding him lay his sandals by, for Lo! he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stood on holy ground. Then Moses bowed his head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his staff and spread his mantle o’er</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His face, lest he should see the dreadful majesty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of God; and there, upon that lonely spot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Horeb’s mount, his shrinking hands received</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The burden of his God, which bade him go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Egypt’s guilty king, and bid him let</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>The oppressed go free.</span>
						<span>Commissioned thus</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gathered up his flocks and herds and sought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tents of Jethro, and said “I pray thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let me go and see if yet my kindred live;”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Jethro bade him go in peace, nor sought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To throw himself across the purpose of his soul.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet there was a tender parting in that home;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There were moistened eyes, and quivering lips,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lingering claspings of the parting hand, as Jethro</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his daughters stood within the light of that</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clean morn, and gave to Moses and his wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sons their holy wishes and their sad farewells.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he had been a son and brother in that home</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since first with manly courtesy he had filled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The empty pails of Reuel’s daughters, and found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A shelter ’neath his tent when flying from</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>The wrath of Pharaoh.</span>
						<span>They journeyed on,</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Moses, Zipporah and sons, she looking back</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With tender love upon the home she had left,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all its precious memories crowding round</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her heart, and he with eager eyes tracking</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His path across the desert, longing once more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see the long-lost faces of his distant home,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The loving eyes so wont to sun him with their</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Welcome, and the aged hands that laid upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His youthful head their parting blessing. They</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Journeyed on till morning’s flush and noonday</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Splendor glided into the softened, mellowed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Light of eve, and the purple mists were deep’ning</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the cliffs and hills, when Horeb, dual</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crowned, arose before him; and there he met</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His brother Aaron, sent by God to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His spokesman and to bear him company</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Pharaoh. Tender and joyous was their greeting.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They talked of home and friends until the lighter</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ripple of their thoughts in deeper channels flowed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then they talked of Israel’s bondage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the great deliverance about to dawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the fortunes of their race; and Moses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Told him of the burning bush, and how the message</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his God was trembling on his lips. And thus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They talked until the risen moon had veiled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mount in soft and silvery light; and then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They rested until morn, and rising up, refreshed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From sleep, pursued their way until they reached</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The land of Goshen, and gathered up the elders</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of their race, and told them of the message</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of their Father’s God. Then eager lips caught up</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The words of hope and passed the joyful news</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around, and all the people bowed their heads</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lifted up their hearts in thankfulness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To God.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i14">That same day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Moses sought an audience with the king. He found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him on his throne surrounded by the princes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his court, who bowed in lowly homage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At his feet. And Pharaoh heard with curving lip</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And flushing cheek the message of the Hebrew’s God</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then asked in cold and scornful tones, “Has</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Israel a God, and if so where has he dwelt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ages? As the highest priest of Egypt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have prayed to Isis, and the Nile has</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Overflowed her banks and filled the land</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With plenty, but these poor slaves have cried unto</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their God, then crept in want and sorrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To their graves. Surely Mizraim’s God is strong</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Israel’s is weak; then wherefore should</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heed his voice, or at his bidding break</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A single yoke?” Thus reasoned that proud king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turned a deafened ear unto the words</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Moses and bis brother, and yet he felt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strangely awed before their presence, because</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They stood as men who felt the grandeur</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of their mission, and thought not of themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of their message.</span>

				<p>
					<span>On the next day Pharaoh called a council</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his mighty men, and before them laid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The message of the brethren: then Amorphel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Keeper of the palace and nearest lord</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the king, arose, and bending low</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before the throne, craved leave to speak a word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amorphel was a crafty, treacherous man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With oily lips well versed in flattery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And courtly speech, a supple reed ready</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To bend before his royal master’s lightest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Breath⁠—Pharaoh’s willing tool. He said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Gracious king, thou has been too lenient</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With these slaves; light as their burdens are, they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fret and chafe beneath them. They are idle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the blood runs riot in their veins. Now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou would’st have these people dwell in peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Increase, I pray thee, their tasks and add unto</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their burdens; if they faint beneath their added</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tasks, they will have less time to plot sedition</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And revolt.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then Rhadma, oldest lord in Pharaoh’s court,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arose. He was an aged man, whose white</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heavy beard hung low upon his breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet there was a hard cold glitter in his eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on his face a proud and evil look.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had been a servant to the former king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wore his signet ring upon his hand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said, “I know this Moses well. Fourscore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Years ago Princess Charmian found him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the Nile and rescued him from death, and did</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Choose him as her son, and had him versed in all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mysteries and lore of Egypt. But blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will tell, and this base slave, with servile blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within his veins, would rather be a servant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than a prince, and so, with rude and reckless hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thrust aside the honors of our dear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Departed king. Pharaoh was justly wroth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for his daughter’s sake he let the trespass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pass. But one day this Moses slew an Egyptian</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his wrath, and then the king did seek his life;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But be fled, it is said, unto the deserts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Arabia, and became a shepherd for the priest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Midian. But now, instead of leading flocks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And herds, he aspires to lead his captive race</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To freedom. These men mean mischief; sedition</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And revolt are in their plans. Decree, I pray thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That these men shall gather their own straw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet their tale of bricks shall be the same.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And these words pleased Pharaoh well, and all his</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lords chimed in with one accord. And Pharaoh</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wrote the stern decree and sent it unto Goshen⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the laborers should gather their own straw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yet they should not ’minish of their tale of bricks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i10">’Twas a sad day in Goshen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The king’s decree hung like a gloomy pall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around their homes. The people fainted ’neath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their added tasks, then cried unto the king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he would ease their burdens; but he hissed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A taunt into their ears and said, “ye are</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Idle, and your minds are filled with vain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And foolish thoughts; get you into your tasks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ye shall not ’minish of your tale of bricks.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i8">And then they turned their eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reproachfully on Moses and his brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And laid the cruel blame upon their shoulders.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis an old story now, but then ’twas new</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the brethren⁠—how God’s anointed ones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must walk with bleeding feet the paths that turn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lines of living light; how hands that bring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Salvation in their palms are pierced with cruel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nails, and lips that quiver first with some great truth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are steeped in bitterness and tears, and brows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now bright beneath the aureola of God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have bent beneath the thorny crowns of earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i10">There was hope for Israel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But they did not see the golden fringes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of their coming morn; they only saw the cold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grey sky, and fainted ’neath the cheerless gloom.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Moses sought again the presence of the king:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Pharaoh’s brow grew dark with wrath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rising up in angry haste, he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Defiantly, “If thy God be great, show</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Us some sign or token of his power.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Moses threw his rod upon the floor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it trembled with a sign of life;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dark wood glowed, then changed into a thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of glistening scales and golden rings, and green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And brown and purple stripes; a hissing, hateful</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thing, that glared its fiery eye, and darting forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Moses’ side, lay coiled and panting</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the monarch’s feet. With wonder open-eyed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The king gazed on the changed rod, then called</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For his magicians⁠—wily men, well versed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In sinful lore⁠—and bade them do the same.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they, leagued with the powers of night, did</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Also change their rods to serpents; then Moses’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Serpent darted forth, and with a startling hiss</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And angry gulp, he swallowed the living things</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That coiled along his path. And thus did Moses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Show that Israel’s God had greater power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Than those dark sons of night.</span>
						<span>But not by this alone</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did God his mighty power reveal: He changed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their waters; every fountain, well and pool</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was red with blood, and lips, all parched with thirst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shrank back in horror from the crimson draughts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then the worshiped Nile grew full of life:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Millions of frogs swarmed from the stream⁠—they clogged</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pathway of the priests and filled the sacred</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fanes, and crowded into Pharaoh’s bed, and hopped</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into his trays of bread, and slumbered in his</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ovens and his pans.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then came another plague, of loathsome vermin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were gray and creeping things, that made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their very clothes alive with dark and sombre</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spots⁠—things so loathsome in the land they did</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suspend the service of the temple; for no priest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dared to lift his hand to any god with one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of these upon him. And then the sky grew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dark, as if a cloud were passing o’er its</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Changeless blue; a buzzing sound broke o’er</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The city, and the land was swarmed with flies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The murrain laid their cattle low; the hail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cut off the first fruits of the Nile; the locusts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With their hungry jaws, destroyed the later crops,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And left the ground as brown and bare as if a fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Had scorched it through.</span>
						<span>Then angry blains</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fiery boils did blur the flesh of man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And beast; and then for three long days, nor saffron</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tint, nor crimson flush, nor soft and silvery light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Divided day from morn, nor told the passage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the hours; men rose not from their seats, but sat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In silent awe. That lengthened night lay like a burden</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the air⁠—a darkness one might almost gather</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his hand, it was so gross and thick. Then came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The last dread plague⁠—the death of the first born.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i14">’Twas midnight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a startling shriek rose from each palace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Home and hut of Egypt, save the blood-besprinkled homes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Goshen; the midnight seemed to shiver with a sense</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of dread, as if the mystic angel’s wing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had chilled the very air with horror.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Death! Death! was everywhere⁠—in every home</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A corpse⁠—in every heart a bitter woe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There were anxious fingerings for the pulse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ne’er would throb again, and eager listenings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For some sound of life⁠—a hurrying to and fro⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then burning kisses on the cold lips</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the dead, bitter partings, sad farewells,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mournful sobs and piercing shrieks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And deep and heavy groans throughout the length</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And breadth of Egypt. ’Twas the last dread plague,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But it had snapped in twain the chains on which</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rust of ages lay, and Israel was freed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only freed, but thrust in eager haste</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From out the land. Trembling men stood by, and longed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see them gather up their flocks and herds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And household goods, and leave the land; because they felt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That death stood at their doors as long as Israel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lingered there; and they went forth in haste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tread the paths of freedom.</span>

					<span>But Pharaoh was strangely blind, and turning</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From his first-born and his dead, with Egypt’s wail</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Scarce still upon his ear, he asked which way had</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Israel gone? They told him that they journeyed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Towards the mighty sea, and were encamped</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Near Baalzephon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Pharaoh said, “the wilderness will hem them in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mighty sea will roll its barriers in front,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with my chariots and my warlike men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll bring them back, or mete them out their graves.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i10">Then Pharaoh’s officers arose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gathered up the armies of the king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made his chariots ready for pursuit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With proud escutcheons blazoned to the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his chariot of ivory, pearl and gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pharaoh rolled out of Egypt; and with him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rode his mighty men, their banners floating</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the breeze, their spears and armor glittering</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the morning light; and Israel saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With fainting hearts, their old oppressors on their</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Track: then women wept in hopeless terror;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Children hid their faces in their mothers’ robes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And strong men bowed their heads in agony and dread;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then a bitter, angry murmur rose⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Were there no graves in Egypt, that thou hast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brought us here to die?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Moses lifted up his face, aglow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With earnest faith in God, and bade their fainting hearts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be strong and they should his salvation see.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Stand still,” said Moses to the fearful throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose hearts were fainting in the wild, “Stand still.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, that was Moses’ word, but higher and greater</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came God’s watchword for the hour, and not for that</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alone, but all the coming hours of time.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Speak ye unto the people and bid them</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forward go; stretch thy hand across the waters</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And smite them with thy rod.” And Moses smote</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The restless sea; the waves stood up in heaps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then lay as calm and still as lips that just</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had tasted death. The secret-loving sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Laid bare her coral caves and iris-tinted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Floor; that wall of flood which lined the people’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Way was God’s own wondrous masonry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The signal pillar sent to guide them through the wild</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Moved its dark shadow till it fronted Egypt’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Camp, but hung in fiery splendor, a light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Israel’s path. Madly rushed the hosts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Pharaoh upon the people’s track, when</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The solemn truth broke on them⁠—that God</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Israel fought. With cheeks in terror</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blenching, and eyes astart with fear, “let</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Us flee,” they cried, “from Israel, for their God</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doth fight against us; he is battling on their side.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They had trusted in their chariots, but now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That hope was vain; God had loosened every</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Axle and unfastened every wheel, and each</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Face did gather blackness and each heart stood still</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With fear, as the livid lightnings glittered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the thunder roared and muttered on the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they saw the dreadful ruin that shuddered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er their heads, for the waves began to tremble</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the wall of flood to bend. Then arose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A cry of terror, baffled hate and hopeless dread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gurgling sound of horror, as the waves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came madly dashing, wildly crashing, seeking</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out their place again, and the flower and pride</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Egypt sank as lead within the sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till the waves threw back their corpses cold and stark</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the shore, and the song of Israel’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Triumph was the requiem of their foes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh the grandeur of that triumph; up the cliffs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And down the valleys, o’er the dark and restless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sea, rose the people’s shout of triumph, going</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up in praise to God, and the very air</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seemed joyous, for the choral song of millions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Throbbed upon its viewless wings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then another song of triumph rose in accents</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soft and clear; ’twas the voice of Moses’ sister</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rising in the tide of song. The warm blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of her childhood seemed dancing in her veins;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The roses of her girlhood were flushing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On her cheek, and her eyes flashed out the splendor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of long departed days, for time itself seemed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pausing, and she lived the past again; again</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Nile flowed by her; she was watching by the stream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little ark of rushes where her baby brother lay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tender tide of rapture swept o’er her soul again</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She had felt when Pharaoh’s daughter had claimed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him as her own, and her mother wept for joy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above her rescued son. Then again she saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him choosing “ ’twixt Israel’s pain and sorrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Egypt’s pomp and pride.” But now he stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their leader triumphant on that shore, and loud</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She struck the cymbals as she led the Hebrew women</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In music, dance and song, as they shouted out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Triumphs in sweet and glad refrains.</span>

					<span>They journeyed on from Zuphim’s sea until</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They reached the sacred mount and heard the solemn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Decalogue. The mount was robed in blackness⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heavy and deep the shadows lay; the thunder</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crashed and roared upon the air; the lightning</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaped from crag to crag; God’s fearful splendor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flowed around, and Sinai quaked and shuddered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To its base, and there did God proclaim</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto their listening ears, the great, the grand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The central and the primal truth of all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>The universe⁠—the unity of God.</span>
						<span>Only one God⁠—</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This truth received into the world’s great life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not as an idle dream nor speculative thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as a living, vitalizing thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should bind us closer to our God and link us</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With our fellow man, the brothers and co-heirs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Christ, the elder brother of our race.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before this truth let every blade of war</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grow dull, and slavery, cowering at the light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Skulk from the homes of men; instead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of war bring peace and freedom, love and joy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And light for man, instead of bondage, whips</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chains. Only one God! the strongest hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should help the weak who bend before the blasts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of life, because if God is only one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then we are the children of his mighty hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when we best serve man, we also serve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our God. Let haughty rulers learn that men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of humblest birth and lowliest lot have</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rights as sacred and divine as theirs, and they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who fence in leagues of earth by bonds and claims</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And title deeds, forgetting land and water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Air and light are God’s own gifts and heritage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For man⁠—who throw their selfish lives between</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God’s sunshine and the shivering poor⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have never learned the wondrous depth, nor scaled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The glorious height of this great central truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around which clusters all the holiest faiths</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of earth. The thunder died upon the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lightning ceased its livid play, the smoke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And darkness died away in clouds, as soft</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fair as summer wreaths that lie around</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The setting sun, and Sinai stood a bare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rugged thing among the sacred scenes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of earth.</span>

					<span>It was a weary thing to bear the burden</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that restless and rebellious race. With</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sinai’s thunders almost crashing in their ears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They made a golden calf, and in the desert</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spread an idol’s feast, and sung the merry songs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They had heard when Mizraim’s songs bowed down before</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their vain and heathen gods; and thus for many years</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did Moses bear the evil manners of his race⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their angry murmurs, fierce regrets and strange</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forgetfulness of God. Born slaves, they did not love</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The freedom of the wild more than their pots of flesh.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pleasant savory things once gathered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the gardens of the Nile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If slavery only laid its weight of chains</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the weary, aching limbs, e’en then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It were a curse; but when it frets through nerve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And flesh and eats into the weary soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh then it is a thing for every human</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heart to loathe, and this was Israel’s fate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when the chains were shaken from their limbs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They failed to strike the impress from their souls.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While he who’d basked beneath the radiance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a throne, ne’er turned regretful eyes upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The past, nor sighed to grasp again the pleasures</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Once resigned; but the saddest trial was</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see the light and joy fade from their faces</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the faithless spies spread through their camp</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their ill report; and when the people wept</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In hopeless unbelief and turned their faces</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Egyptward, and asked a captain from their bands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lead them back where they might bind anew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their broken chains, when God arose and shut</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gates of promise on their lives, and left</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their bones to bleach beneath Arabia’s desert sands.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But though they slumbered in the wild, they died</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With broader freedom on their lips, and for their</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Little ones did God reserve the heritage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So rudely thrust aside.</span>

					<span>His work was done; his blessing lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like precious ointment on his people’s head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And God’s great peace was resting on his soul.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His life had been a lengthened sacrifice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thing of deep devotion to his race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since first he turned his eyes on Egypt’s gild</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And glow, and clasped their fortunes in his hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And held them with a firm and constant grasp.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now his work was done; his charge was laid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Joshua’s hand, and men of younger blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were destined to possess the land and pass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through Jordan to the other side. He too</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had hoped to enter there⁠—to tread the soil</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made sacred by the memories of his</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kindred dead, and rest till life’s calm close beneath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sheltering vines and stately palms of that</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fair land; that hope had colored all his life’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Young dreams and sent its mellowed flushes o’er</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His later years; but God’s decree was otherwise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so he bowed his meekened soul in calm</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Submission to the word, which bade him climb</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Nebo’s highest peak, and view the pleasant land</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Jordan’s swells unto the calmer ripples</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the tideless sea, then die with all its</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loveliness in sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he passed from Moab’s grassy vale to climb</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rugged mount, the people stood in mournful groups,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some, with quivering lips and tearful eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reaching out unconscious hands, as if to stay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His steps and keep him ever at their side, while</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Others gazed with reverent awe upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The calm and solemn beauty on his aged brow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The look of loving trust and lofty faith</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still beaming from an eye that neither care</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor time had dimmed. As he passed upward, tender</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blessings, earnest prayers and sad farewells rose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On each wave of air, then died in one sweet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murmur of regretful love; and Moses stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>Alone on Nebo’s mount.</span>
						<span>Alone! not one</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all that mighty throng who had trod with him</span>

					<span>In triumph through the parted flood was there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aaron had died in Hor, with son and brother</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By his side; and Miriam too was gone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But kindred hands had made her grave, and Kadesh</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Held her dust. But he was all alone; nor wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor child was there to clasp in death his hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bind around their bleeding hearts the precious</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Parting words. And yet he was not all alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For God’s great presence flowed around his path</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stayed him in that solemn hour.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i2">He stood upon the highest peak of Nebo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw the Jordan chafing through its gorges,</span>

					<span>And purple blossoms. The placid lakes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And emerald meadows, the snowy crest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of distant mountains, the ancient rocks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That dripped with honey, the hills all bathed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In light and beauty; the shady groves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And peaceful vistas, the vines opprest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With purple riches, the fig trees fruit-crowned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Green and golden, the pomegranates with crimson</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blushes, the olives with their darker clusters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rose before him like a vision, full of beauty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And delight. Gazed he on the lovely landscape</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till it faded from his view, and the wing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of death’s sweet angel hovered o’er the mountain’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crest, and he heard his garments rustle through</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="dl2">
						<span>The watches of the night.</span>
						<span>Then another, fairer, vision</span>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Broke upon his longing gaze; ’twas the land</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of crystal fountains, love and beauty, joy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And light, for the pearly gates flew open,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his ransomed soul went in. And when morning</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er the mountain fringed each crag and peak with light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cold and lifeless lay the leader. God had touched</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His eyes with slumber, giving his beloved sleep.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Oh never on that mountain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was seen a lovelier sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than the troupe of fair young angels</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That gathered ’round the dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With gentle hands they bore bim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That bright and shining train,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Nebo’s lonely mountain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sleep in Moab’s vale.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But they sung no mornful dirges,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No solemn requiems said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the soft wave of their pinions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made music as they trod.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But no one heard them passing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None saw their chosen grave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was the angels’ secret</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where Moses should be laid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the grave was finished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They trod with golden sandals</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above the sacred spot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the brightest, fairest flowers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sprang up beneath their tread.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor broken turf, nor hillock</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did e’er reveal that grave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And truthful lips have never said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We know where he is laid.</span>

				<span>A rock, for ages, stern and high,</span>

				<span>Stood frowning ’gainst the earth and sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And never bowed his haughty crest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When angry storms around him prest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Morn springing from the arms of night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had often bathed his brow with light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kissed the shadows from his face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With tender love and gentle grace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Day, pausing at the gates of rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smiled on him from the distant West,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from her throne the dark-browed Night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threw round his path her softest light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet he stood unmoved and proud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor love, nor wrath, his spirit bowed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He bared his brow to every blast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scorned the tempest as it passed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One day a tiny, humble seed⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The keenest eye would hardly heed⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell trembling at that stern rock’s base,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found a lowly hiding place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A ray of light, and drop of dew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came with a message, kind and true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They told her of the world so bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its love, its joy, and rosy light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lured her from her hiding place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To gaze upon earth’s glorious face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, peeping timid from the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She clasped the ancient rock around,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And climbing up with childish grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She held him with a close embrace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her clinging was a thing of dread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where’er she touched a fissure spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he who’d breasted many a storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood frowning there, a mangled form;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Truth dropped in the silent earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May seem a thing of little worth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till, spreading round some mighty wrong,</span>

				<span>It saps its pillars proud and strong.</span>

				<span>Was freedom in death or the life of a slave.</span>

				<span>For a fearful death and a bloody grave</span>

				<span>Our hearts are still unsatisfied.</span>

			<p>
				<span>We would see Jesus; proud and high</span>

				<br/>
				<span>We’ve gazed upon the glorious thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By earnest hands in marble wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And listened where the lying feet</span>

				<span>Beat time to music, soft and sweet;</span>

				<span>Our yearning hearts ne’er satisfied.</span>

				<span>Instead of orange-blossoms fair,</span>

				<span>Willow and cypress wreathed her hair.</span>

				<span>Then the balmy rains and sunshine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scatter treasures o’er the soil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Till a place for human footprints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crown the little builder’s toil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the stately ships sweep o’er them,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Little think these patient toilers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They are building man a home.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Do you ask me, precious children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How your little hands can build,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you love the name of freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But your fingers are unskilled?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not on thrones or in proud temples,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Does fair freedom seek her rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No, her chosen habitations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are the hearts that love her best.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Would you gain the highest freedom?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Live for God and man alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then each heart in freedom’s temple,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will be like a living stone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fill your minds with useful knowledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Learn to love the true and right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus you’ll build the throne of freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On a pedestal of light.</span>

				<span>Dear father, I hear a whisper,</span>

			<p>
				<span>I remember, well remember,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That dark and dreadful day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they whispered to me, “Chloe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your children’s sold away!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It seemed as if a bullet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had shot me through and through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I felt as if my heart-strings</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was breaking right in two.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I says to cousin Milly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“There must be some mistake;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where’s Mistus?” “In the great house crying⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crying like her heart would break.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And the lawyer’s there with Mistus;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Says he’s come to ’ministrate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Cause when master died he just left</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heap of debt on the estate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And I thought ’twould do you good</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bid your boys good-bye⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To kiss them both and shake their hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And have a hearty cry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh! Chloe, I knows how you feel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Cause I’se been through it all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I thought my poor old heart would break,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When master sold my Saul.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Just then I heard the footsteps</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of my children at the door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I rose right up to meet them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I fell upon the floor.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I heard poor Jakey saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Oh, mammy, don’t you cry!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I felt my children kiss me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bid me, both, good-bye.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then I had a mighty sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though I nursed it all alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I wasted to a shadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And turned to skin and bone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But one day dear Uncle Jacob</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(In heaven he’s now a saint)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said, “Your poor heart is in the fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But child you must not faint.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then I said to Uncle Jacob,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I was good like you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the heavy trouble dashed me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’d know just what to do.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Then he said to me, “Poor Chloe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The way is open wide:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he told me of the Saviour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the fountain in His side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he said “Just take your burden</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the blessed Master’s feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I takes all my troubles, Chloe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Right unto the mercy-seat.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His words waked up my courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I began to pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I felt my heavy burden</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rolling like a stone away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And a something seemed to tell me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You will see your boys again⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that hope was like a poultice</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spread upon a dreadful pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And it often seemed to whisper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Chloe, trust and never fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You’ll get justice in the kingdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If you do not get it here.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Master only left old Mistus</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One bright and handsome boy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she fairly doted on him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was her pride and joy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We all liked Mister Thomas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was so kind at heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the young folks got in scrapes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He always took their part.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He kept right on that very way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he got big and tall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And old Mistus used to chide him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And say he’d spile us all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But somehow the farm did prosper</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he took things in hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though all the servants liked him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He made them understand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One evening Mister Thomas said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Just bring my easy shoes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am going to sit by mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And read her up the news.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon I heard him tell old Mistus</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“We’re bound to have a fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we’ll whip the Yankees, mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We’ll whip them sure as night!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then I saw old Mistus tremble;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She gasped and held her breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she looked on Mister Thomas</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a face as pale as death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“They are firing on Fort Sumpter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh! I wish that I was there!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why, dear mother! what’s the matter?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You’re the picture of despair.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I was thinking, dearest Thomas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould break my very heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If a fierce and dreadful battle</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should tear our lives apart.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“None but cowards, dearest mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would skulk unto the rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the tyrant’s hand is shaking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All the heart is holding dear.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I felt sorry for old Mistus;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She got too full to speak;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I saw the great big tear-drops</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A running down her cheek.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mister Thomas too was troubled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With choosing on that night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixt staying with his mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And joining in the fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon down into the village came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A call for volunteers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mistus gave up Mister Thomas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With many sighs and tears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His uniform was real handsome;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He looked so brave and strong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But somehow I couldn’t help thinking</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His fighting must be wrong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though the house was very lonesome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I thought ’twould all come right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I felt somehow or other</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We was mixed up in that fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I said to Uncle Jacob,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Now old Mistus feels the sting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this parting with your children</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is a mighty dreadful thing.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Never mind,” said Uncle Jacob,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Just wait and watch and pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I feel right sure and certain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slavery’s bound to pass away;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Because I asked the Spirit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If God is good and just,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How it happened that the masters</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did grind us to the dust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And something reasoned right inside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such should not always be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you could not beat it out my head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Spirit spoke to me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And his dear old eyes would brighten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his lips put on a smile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, “Pick up faith and courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And just wait a little while.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mistus prayed up in the parlor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the Secesh all might win;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We were praying in the cabins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wanting freedom to begin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mister Thomas wrote to Mistus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Telling ’bout the Bull’s Run fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his troops had whipped the Yankees</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And put them all to flight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mistus’ eyes did fairly glisten;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She laughed and praised the South,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I thought some day she’d laugh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On tother side her mouth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I used to watch old Mistus’ face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when it looked quite long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would say to Cousin Milly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The battle’s going wrong;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not for us, but for the Rebels.⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My heart ’would fairly skip,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Uncle Jacob used to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“The North is bound to whip.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And let the fight go as it would⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let North or South prevail⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He always kept his courage up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And never let it fail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And he often used to tell us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Children, don’t forget to pray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the darkest time of morning</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is just ’fore the break of day.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well, one morning bright and early</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We heard the fife and drum,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the booming of the cannon⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Yankee troops had come.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the word ran through the village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The colored folks are free⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the kitchens and the cabins</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We held a jubilee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they told us Mister Lincoln</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Said that slavery was dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We just poured our prayers and blessings</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his precious head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We just laughed, and danced, and shouted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And prayed, and sang, and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we thought dear Uncle Jacob</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would fairly crack his side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when old Mistus heard it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She groaned and hardly spoke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she had to lose her servants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her heart was almost broke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas a sight to see our people</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Going out, the troops to meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Almost dancing to the music,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And marching down the street.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After years of pain and parting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our chains was broke in two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we was so mighty happy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We didn’t know what to do.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But we soon got used to freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though the way at first was rough;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we weathered through the tempest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For slavery made us tough.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But we had one awful sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It almost turned my head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a mean and wicked cretur</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shot Mister Lincoln dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas a dreadful solemn morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I just staggered on my feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the women they were crying</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And screaming in the street.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But if many prayers and blessings</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could bear him to the throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should think when Mister Lincoln died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That heaven just got its own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then we had another President⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What do you call his name?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, if the colored folks forget him</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They wouldn’t be much to blame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We thought he’d be the Moses</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all the colored race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the Rebels pressed us hard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He never showed his face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But something must have happened him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Right curi’s I’ll be bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Cause I heard ’em talking ’bout a circle</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he was swinging round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But everything will pass away⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He went like time and tide⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the next election came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They let poor Andy slide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But now we have a President,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if I was a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’d vote for him for breaking up</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wicked Ku Klux Klan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And if any man should ask me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I would sell my vote,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’d tell him I was not the one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To change and turn my coat;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If freedom seem’d a little rough</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’d weather through the gale;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as to buying up my vote,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I hadn’t it for sale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I do not think I’d ever be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As slack as Jonas Handy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because I heard he sold his vote</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For just three sticks of candy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when John Thomas Reeder brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His wife some flour and meat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And told her he had sold his vote</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For something good to eat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You ought to seen Aunt Kitty raise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And heard her blaze away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She gave the meat and flour a toss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said they should not stay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I should think he felt quite cheap</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For voting the wrong side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when Aunt Kitty scolded him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He just stood up and cried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the worst fooled man I ever saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was when poor David Rand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sold out for flour and sugar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sugar was mixed with sand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I’ll tell you how the thing got out;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His wife had company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she thought the sand was sugar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And served it up for tea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When David sipped and sipped the tea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Somehow it didn’t taste right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I guess when he found he was sipping sand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was mad enough to fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sugar looked so nice and white⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It was spread some inches deep⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But underneath was a lot of sand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such sugar is mighty cheap.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You’d laughed to seen Lucinda Grange</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon her husband’s track;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he sold his vote for rations</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She made him take ’em back.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Day after day did Milly Green</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Just follow after Joe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And told him if he voted wrong</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To take his rags and go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I think that Curnel Johnson said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His side had won the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had not we women radicals</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Just got right in the way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And yet I would not have you think</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That all our men are shabby;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ’tis said in every flock of sheep</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There will be one that’s scabby.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I’ve heard, before election came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They tried to buy John Slade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he gave them all to understand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he wasn’t in that trade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And we’ve got lots of other men</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who rally round the cause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And go for holding up the hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That gave us equal laws.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who know their freedom cost too much</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of blood and pain and treasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For them to fool away their votes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For profit or for pleasure.</span>

				<span>I remember Uncle Caldwell,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Well, the Northern folks kept sending</span>

				<span>We ought all to come together</span>

				<span>Tidings! sad tidings for the daughter of Ai,</span>

				<span>They are bearing her prince and loved away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Destruction falls like a mournful pall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the fallen house of ill-fated Saul.</span>

			<p>

				<br/>
				<span>And clasping her hand with grief and dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She meekly bows her queenly head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The blood has left her blanching cheek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her quivering lips refuse to speak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh! grief like hers has learned no tone⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A world of grief is all its own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the deed is done, and the hand is stay’d</span>

				<span>That havoc among the brethren made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Rizpah takes her lowly seat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To watch the princely dead at her feet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The jackal crept out with a stealthy tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To batten and feast on the noble dead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vulture bore down with a heavy wing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dip his beak in life’s stagnant spring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The hyena heard the jackal’s howl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he bounded forth with a sullen growl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Rizpah’s shriek rose on the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a tone from the caverns of despair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She sprang from her sad and lowly seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For a moment her heart forgot to beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the blood rushed up to her marble cheek</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a flash to her eye so sad and meek.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The vulture paused in his downward flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As she raised her form to its queenly height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hyena’s eye had a horrid glare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he turned again to his desert lair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The jackal slunk back with a quickened tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his cowardly search of Rizpah’s dead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unsated he turned from the noble prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Subdued by a glance of the daughter of Ai.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh grief! that a mother’s heart should know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such a weary weight of consuming woe,</span>

				<span>For seldom if ever earth has known</span>

				<span>Such love as the daughter of Ai hath known.</span>

				<span>You’ve seen me plant a tender vine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And guard it with patient care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till its roots struck in the mellow earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And it drank the light and air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So God did plant our chosen race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As a vine in this fair land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we grew and spread a fruitful tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The planting of his right hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The time would fail strove I to tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All the story of our race⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of our grand old leader, Moses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Joshua in his place,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of all our rulers and judges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Joshua unto Saul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over whose doomed and guilty head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell ruin and death’s dark pall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of valiant Jephthah, whose brave heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sudden grief did bow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When his daughter came with dance and song</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unconscious of his vow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of Gideon, lifting up his voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him who rules the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wringing out his well drenched fleece,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When all around was dry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How Deborah, ’neath her spreading palms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A judge in Israel rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wrested victory from the hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Jacob’s heathen foes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of Samuel, an upright judge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The last who ruled our tribes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose noble life and cleanly hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were pure and free from bribes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of David, with his checkered life</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our tuneful minstrel king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who breathed in sadness and delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The psalms we love to sing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of Solomon, whose wandering heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Jacob’s God did stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cast the richest gifts of life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In pleasure’s cup away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How aged men advised his son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But found him weak and vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until the kingdom from his hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was rudely rent in twain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! sin and strife are fearful things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They widen as they go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leave behind them shades of death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And open gates of woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A trail of guilt, a gloomy line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ran through our nation’s life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wicked kings provoked our God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sin and woe were rife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At length, there came a day of doom⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A day of grief and dread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When judgment like a fearful storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swept o’er our country’s head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And we were captives many years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Babel’s stream doth flow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With harps unstrung, on willows hung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We wept in silent woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We could not sing the old, sweet songs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our captors asked to hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hearts were full, how could we sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The songs to us so dear?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As one who dreams a mournful dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which fades, as wanes the night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So God did change our gloomy lot</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From darkness into light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Belshazzar in his regal halls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A sumptuous feast did hold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He praised his gods and drank his wine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From sacred cups of gold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When dance and song and revelry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had filled with mirth each hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Belshazzar raised his eyes and saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A writing on the wall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He saw, and horror blanched his cheek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His lips were white with fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To read the words he quickly called</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For wise men, far and near.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But baffled seers, with anxious doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood silent in the room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Daniel came, a captive youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And read the words of doom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That night, within his regal hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Belshazzar lifeless lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Persians grasped his fallen crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the Mede held sway.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Darius came, and Daniel rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A man of high renown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But wicked courtiers schemed and planned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To drag the prophet down.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They came as men who wished to place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Great honors on their king⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With flattering lips and oily words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desired a certain thing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They knew that Daniel, day by day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards Salem turned his face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And asked the king to sign a law</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His hands might not erase.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That till one moon had waned away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No cherished wish or thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should any ask of men or Gods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless it were the king.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Daniel, full of holy trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His windows opened wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Regardless of the king’s command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto his God he cried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They brought him forth that he might be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hungry lion’s meat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awe struck, the lions turned away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And crouched anear his feet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The God he served was strong to save</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His servant in the den;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fate devised for Daniel’s life</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’er took those scheming men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Cyrus came, a gracious king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gave the blest command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That we, the scattered Jews, should build</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anew our fallen land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The men who hated Judah’s weal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were filled with bitter rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ’gainst the progress of our work</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did evil men engage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sanballat tried to hinder us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Gashmu uttered lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But like a thing of joy and light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We saw our temple rise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And from the tower of Hananeel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto the corner gate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We built the wall and did restore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The places desolate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some mocked us as we labored on</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scoffingly did say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If but a fox climb on the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their work will give away.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Nehemiah wrought in hope,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though heathen foes did frown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My work is great,” he firmly said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And I cannot come down.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when Shemai counselled him</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The temple door to close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hide, lest he should fall a prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto his cruel foes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Strong in his faith, he answered, “No,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would oppose the tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should such as he from danger flee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the temple hide?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We wrought in earnest faith and hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until we built the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then, unto a joyful feast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did priest and people call.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We came to dedicate the wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sacrifice and joy⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A happy throng, from aged sire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto the fair-haired boy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our lips so used to mournful songs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did joyous laughter fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strong men wept with sacred joy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To stand on Zion’s hill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mid scoffing foes and evil men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We built our city blest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ’neath our sheltering vines and palms</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To-day in peace we rest.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Missing to-night the charming bliss,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>The man is weak if he can’t refrain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the cup you say is fraught with pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was something to her in after years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When her eyes were drenched with burning tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she watched in lonely grief and dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And startled to hear a staggering tread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It is nothing to me, the mother said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have no fear that my boy will tread</span>

				<br/>
				<span>And crush my heart and darken his name.</span>

				<span>It was something to her when that only son</span>

				<span>From the path of right was early won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And madly cast in the flowing bowl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A ruined body and sin-wrecked soul.</span>

			<p>
				<span>It is nothing to me, the young man cried:</span>

				<br/>
				<span>I heed not the dreadful things ye tell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can rule myself I know full well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was something to him when in prison he lay</span>

				<span>The victim of drink, life ebbing away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thought of his wretched child and wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the mournful wreck of his wasted life.</span>

				<br/>
				<span>I’m busy to-day with tare and tret,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I have no time to fume and fret.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was something to him when over the wire</span>

				<span>A message came from a funeral pyre⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A drunken conductor had wrecked a train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his wife and child were among the slain.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of sorrow and of sin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I turned, and saw behind me surge</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A wild and stormy sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drowning men were reaching out</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Imploring hands to me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And ev’ry lip was blanched with dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And moaning for relief;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The music of the golden harps</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grew fainter for their grief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let me return, I quickly said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Close to the pearly gate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My work is with these wretched ones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So wrecked and desolate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>An angel smiled and gently said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This is the gate of life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou return to earth’s sad scenes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its weariness and strife,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To comfort hearts that sigh and break,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To dry the falling tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou forego the music sweet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Entrancing now thy ear?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I must return, I firmly said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The struggles in that sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not reach out beseeching hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In vain for help to me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I turned to go; but as I turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gloomy sea grew bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from my heart there seemed to flow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ten thousand cords of light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And sin-wrecked men, with eager hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did grasp each golden cord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with my heart I drew them on</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see my gracious Lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Again I stood beside the gate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My heart was glad and free;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For with me stood a rescued throng</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Lord had given me.</span>

				<span class="i1">One day with joy and pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With orange blossoms in her hair,</span>

				<span>I’ve drenched her soul with floods of grief,</span>
				<br/>

			<p>
				<span>Do you see that gray-haired mother bend</span>

				<span class="i1">Beneath her weight of years?</span>

				<span>Year after year for me she prays,</span>

				<span>I’ve almost brought her gray hairs down</span>

				<span class="i1">In sorrow to the grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Do you see that boy whose wistful eyes</span>
				<br/>

				<span>Do you see this pledge I’ve signed to-night?</span>

				<span class="i1">My mother, wife, and boy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall read my purpose on that pledge</span>

				<span class="i1">And smile through tears of joy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To know this night, this very night,</span>

				<span>The deeds of heroes, on whose brows</span>

			<p>
				<span>From the peaceful heights of a higher life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I heard your maddening cry of strife;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It quivered with anguish, wrath and pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a demon struggling with his chain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A chain of evil, heavy and strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rusted with ages of fearful wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Encrusted with blood and burning tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The chain I had worn and dragged for years.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It clasped my limbs, but it bound your heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And formed of your life a fearful part;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You sowed the wind, but could not control</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tempest wild of a guilty soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You saw me stand with my broken chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forged in the furnace of fiery pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You saw my children around me stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lovingly clasping my unbound hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But you remembered my blood and tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Mid the weary wasting flight of years.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You thought of the rice swamps, lone and dank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When my heart in hopless anguish sank.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You thought of your fields with harvest white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where I toiled in pain from morn till night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You thought of the days you bought and sold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The children I loved, for paltry gold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You thought of our shrieks that rent the air⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our moans of anguish and deep despair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With chattering teeth and paling face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You thought of your nation’s deep disgrace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You wove from your fears a fearful fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To spring from your seeds of scorn and hate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You imagined the saddest, wildest thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That time, with revenges fierce, could bring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The cry you thought from a Voodoo breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was the echo of your soul’s unrest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thoughts too sad for fruitless tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loomed like the ghosts of avenging years.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh, prophet of evil, could not your voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In our new hopes and freedom rejoice?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Mid the light which streams around our way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was there naught to see but an evil day?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nothing but vengeance, wrath and hate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the serpent coils of an evil fate⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fate that shall crush and drag you down;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A doom that shall press like an iron crown?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A fate that shall crisp and curl your hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And darken your faces now so fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And send through your veins like a poisoned flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hated stream of the Negro’s blood?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A fate to madden the heart and brain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You’ve peopled with phantoms of dread and pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fancies wild of your daughter’s shriek</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Congo kisses upon her cheek?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beyond the mist of your gloomy fears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I see the promise of brighter years.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the dark I see their golden hem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my heart gives out its glad amen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The banner of Christ was your sacred trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But you trailed that banner in the dust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mockingly told us amid our pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hand of your God had forged our chain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We stumbled and groped through the dreary night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till our fingers touched God’s robe of light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we knew He heard, from his lofty throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our saddest cries and faintest moan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The cross you have covered with sin and shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We’ll bear aloft in Christ’s holy name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, never again may its folds be furled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While sorrow and sin enshroud our world!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>God, to whose fingers thrills each heart beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has not sent us to walk with aimless feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cower and crouch, with bated breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From margins of life to shores of death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Higher and better than hate for hate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the scorpion fangs that desolate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is the hope of a brighter, fairer morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a peace and a love that shall yet be born;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the Negro shall hold an honored place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The friend and helper of every race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mission to build and not destroy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gladden the world with love and joy.</span>

					<p>The following news item appeared in the newspapers throughout the country, issue of December 27th, 1894:</p>
					<p>“Tim Thompson, a little negro boy, was asked to dance for the amusement of some white toughs. He refused, saying he was a church member. One of the men knocked him down with a club and then danced upon his prostrate form. He then shot the boy in the hip. The boy is dead: his murderer is still at large.”</p>

				<br/>
				<span>Where cold and brutal cowardice</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had left its evil trace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was when tender memories</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Round Beth’lem’s manger lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mothers told their little ones</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Jesu’s natal day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And of the Magi from the East</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who came their gifts to bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bow in rev’rence at the feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Salem’s new-born King.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And how the herald angels sang</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The choral song of peace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That war should close his wrathful lips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And strife and carnage cease.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At such an hour men well may hush</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their discord and their strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er that manger clasp their hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With gifts to brighten life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alas! that in our favored land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That cruelty and crime</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should cast their shadows o’er a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fairest pearl of time.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A dark-browed boy had drawn anear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A band of savage men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just as a hapless lamb might stray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into a tiger’s den.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cruel and dull, they saw in him</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For sport an evil chance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then demanded of the child</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To give to them a dance.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Come dance for us,” the rough men said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I can’t,” the child replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I cannot for the dear Lord’s sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for my sins once died.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though they were strong and he was weak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wouldn’t his Lord deny.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His life lay in their cruel hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he for Christ could die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Heard they aright? Did that brave child</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their mandates dare resist?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did he against their stern commands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have courage to resist?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then recklessly a man (?) arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dealt a fearful blow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He crushed the portals of that life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And laid the brave child low.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And trampled on his prostrate form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As on a broken toy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then danced with careless, brutal feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the murdered boy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Christians! behold that martyred child!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His blood cries from the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the sleepless eye of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He shows each gaping wound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! Church of Christ arise! arise!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest crimson stain thy hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When God shall inquisition make</span>

				<span>Take sackcloth of the darkest hue,</span>

				<span class="i1">And shroud the pulpits round;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Servants of him who cannot lie</span>

				<span class="i1">Sit mourning on the ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let holy horror blanch each brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pale every cheek with fears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rocks and stones, if ye could speak,</span>

				<span class="i1">Ye well might melt to tears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through every fane send forth a cry,</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Night of Death</h2>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas a night of dreadful horror⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Death was sweeping through the land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wings of dark destruction</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were outstretched from strand to strand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Strong men’s hearts grew faint with terror,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the tempest and the waves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrecked their homes and swept them downward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suddenly to yawning graves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Mid the wastes of ruined households,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the tempest’s wild alarms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood a terror-stricken mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a child within her arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Other children huddled ’round her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each one nestling in her heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swift in thought and swift in action,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She at least from one must part.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then she said unto her daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Strive to save one child from death.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Which one?” said the anxious daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As she stood with bated breath.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! the anguish of that mother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What despair was in her eye!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All her little ones were precious;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which one should she leave to die?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then outspake the brother Bennie:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I will take the little one.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No,” exclaimed the anxious mother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“No, my child, it can’t be done.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“See! my boy, the waves are rising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save yourself and leave the child!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will trust in Christ,” he answered;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grasped the little one and smiled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through the roar of wind and waters</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever and anon she cried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But throughout the night of terror</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never Bennie’s voice replied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But above the waves’ wild surging</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had found a safe retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if God had sent an angel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Just to guide his wandering feet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the storm had spent its fury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the sea gave up its dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She was mourning for her loved ones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lost amid that night of dread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While her head was bowed in anguish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On her ear there fell a voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bringing surcease to her sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bidding all her heart rejoice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Didn’t I tell you true?” said Bennie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his eyes were full of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“When I told you God would help me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the dark and dreadful night?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And he placed the little darling</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Safe within his mother’s arms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feeling Christ had been his guardian,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid the dangers and alarms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! for faith so firm and precious,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the darkest, saddest night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till life’s gloom-encircled shadows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fade in everlasting light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And upon the mount of vision</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We our loved and lost shall greet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With earth’s wildest storms behind us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And its cares beneath our feet.</span>

				<span>The treacherous sands had caught our boat,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>And death at our imprisoned crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was sternly looking face to face.</span>

			<p>
				<span>With anxious hearts, but failing strength,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Around us in a fearful storm</span>

				<span>A longing to see the dear old home</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lives like chaff were thrown away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rome with all her pride and power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Butchered for a holiday.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Eagerly the crowd were waiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loud the clashing sabres rang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When between the gladiators</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All unarmed a hermit sprang.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Cease your bloodshed,” cried the hermit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“On this carnage place your ban;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But with flashing swords they answered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Back unto your place, old man.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From their path the gladiators</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thrust the strange intruder back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who between their hosts advancing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calmly parried their attack.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All undaunted by their weapons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood the old heroic man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While a maddened cry of anger</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the vast assembly ran.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Down with him,” cried out the people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As with thumbs unbent they glared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the prefect gave the signal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That his life should not be spared.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Men grew wild with wrathful passion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When his fearless words were said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cruelly they fiercely showered</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stones on his devoted head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bruised and bleeding fell the hermit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Victor in that hour of strife;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaining in his death a triumph</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he could not win in life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Had he uttered on the forum</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Struggling thoughts within him born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men had jeered his words as madness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But his deed they could not scorn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not in vain had been his courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor for naught his daring deed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his grave his mangled body</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did for wretched captives plead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From that hour Rome, grown more thoughtful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ceased her sport in human gore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And into her Colosseum</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gladiators came no more.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Music to soothe all its sorrow,</span>

				<span>You can mourn o’er the exile of Russia</span>

			<p>
				<span>You can pity the men who have woven</span>

				<br/>
				<span>To coil with a terrible tension</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Around their heart-strings and brains.</span>

				<span>You can sorrow o’er little children</span>

				<span class="i1">Disinherited from their birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wee waifs and toddlers neglected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Robbed of sunshine, music and mirth.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Over their tortured and their slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On their brows the sun has left traces;</span>

				<span>When they entered the threshold of being</span>

				<span class="i1">The children of a King were born.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Each comes as a guest to the table</span>

			<p>
				<span>When ye plead for the wrecked and fallen,</span>

				<span>“Build me a nation,” said the Lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The distant nations heard the word,</span>

				<span>Build me a nation true and strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bar out the old world’s hate and wrong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For men had traced with blood and tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The trail of weary wasting years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And torn and bleeding martyrs trod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through fire and torture up to God.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While in the hollow of his hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God hid the secret of our land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men warred against their fiercest foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kingdoms fell and empires rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till, weary of the old world strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men sought for broader, freer life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And plunged into the ocean’s foam</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find another, better home.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, like a vision fair and bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The new world broke upon their sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men grasped the prize, grew proud and strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cursed the land with crime and wrong.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Indian stood despoiled of lands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Negro bound with servile bands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oppressed through weary years of toil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His blood and tears bedewed the soil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then God arose in dreadful wrath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And judgment streamed around his path;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hand the captive’s fetters broke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His lightnings shattered every yoke.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Israel through the Red Sea trod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led by the mighty hand of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They passed to freedom through a flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose every wave and surge was blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And slavery, with its crime and shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went down in wrath and blood and flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The land was billowed o’er with graves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where men had lived and died as slaves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Four and thirty years⁠—what change since then!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beings once chattles now are men;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the gloom of slavery’s night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has flashed the dawn of freedom’s light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To-day no mother with anguish wild</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kneels and implores that her darling child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not be torn from her bleeding heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its quivering tendrils rent apart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The father may soothe his child to sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And watch his slumbers calm and deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No tyrant’s tread will disturb his rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where freedom dwells as a welcome guest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His walls may be bare of pictured grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His fireside the lowliest place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the wife and children sheltered there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are his to defend and guard with care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where haughty tyrants once bore rule</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are ballot-box and public school.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The old slave-pen of former days</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives place to fanes of prayer and praise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To-night we would bring our meed of praise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To noble friends of darker days;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The men and women crowned with light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The true and tried in our gloomy night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Lundy, whose heart was early stirred</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To speak for freedom an earnest word;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Garrison, valiant, true and strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose face was as flint against our wrong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Phillips, the peerless, grand and brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tower of strength to the outcast slave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth has no marble too pure and white</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To enrol his name in golden light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our Douglass, too, with his massive brain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who plead our cause with his broken chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And helped to hurl from his bloody seat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The curse that writhed and died at his feet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Governor Andrew, who, looking back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw none he despised, though poor and black;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Harriet Beecher, whose glowing pen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Corroded the chains of fettered men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To-night with greenest laurels we’ll crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>North Elba’s grave where sleeps John Brown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who made the gallows an altar high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And showed how a brave old man could die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Lincoln, our martyred President,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who returned to his God with chains he had rent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Sumner, amid death’s icy chill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaving to Hoar his Civil Rights Bill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let us remember old underground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all her passengers northward bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The train that ran till it ceased to pay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all her dividends given away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor let it be said that we have forgot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The women who stood with Lucretia Mott;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor her who to the world was known</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the simple name of Lucy Stone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tribute unto a host of others</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who knew that men though black were brothers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who battled against our nation’s sin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose graves are thick whose ranks are thin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh, people chastened in the fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To nobler, grander things aspire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the new era of your life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring love for hate, and peace for strife;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon your hearts this vow record</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ye will build unto the Lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A nobler future, true and grand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To strengthen, crown and bless the land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A higher freedom ye may gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than that which comes from a riven chain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freedom your native land to bless</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With peace, and love and righteousness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As dreams that are past, a tale all told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are the days when men were bought and sold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now God be praised from sea to sea,</span>

				<span>Our flag floats o’er a country free.</span>

				<span class="i1">That gather round her name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And friends have placed upon my brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The laurels of renown;</span>

				<span>But she first taught me how to wear</span>

			<p>
				<span>My hair is silvered o’er with age,</span>

			<p>
				<span>To roam with her the glory-land</span>

			<p>
				<span>Do you see this grain of sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lying loosely in my hand?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do you know to me it brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just a simple loving thought?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When one gazes night by night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the glorious stars of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh how little seems the span</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Measured round the life of man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! how fleeting are his years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their smiles and their tears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can it be that God does care</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For such atoms as we are?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then outspake this grain of sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I was fashioned by His hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the star lit realms of space</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I was made to have a place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Should the ocean flood the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were its mountains ’gainst me hurled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the force they could employ</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wouldn’t a single grain destroy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if I, a thing so light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have a place within His sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You are linked unto his throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot live nor die alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In the everlasting arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mid life’s dangers and alarms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let calm trust your spirit fill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know He’s God, and then be still.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trustingly I raised my head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hearing what the atom said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knowing man is greater far</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than the brightest sun or star.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Soon a host of lovely flowers</span>

			<p>
				<span>And their loved and white haired mother</span>

				<span>When she knew her faithful children</span>

				<span>Heavy hearted, sorrow stricken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sat a mother and her child.</span>

			<p>
				<span>There was not a voice to cheer her</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not a soul to share her fate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She was weary, he was fainting⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And life seemed so desolate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Far away in sunny Egypt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was lone Hagar’s native land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the Nile in kingly bounty</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scatters bread throughout the land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the tents of princely Abram</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She for years had found a home;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the stern decree of Sarah</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sent her forth the wild to roam.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hour by hour she journeyed onward</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the shelter of their tent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till her footsteps slowly faltered</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the water all was spent;</span>

			<p>
				<span>Then she veiled her face in sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feared her child would die of thirst;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till her eyes with tears so holden</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saw a sparkling fountain burst.</span>

			<p>

				<span class="i1">What a soothing of her pain;</span>

				<span>When she saw her child reviving,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Just to bask beside a fountain</span>

				<span class="i1">Making gladder life’s highway.</span>

				<span>Bringing unto hearts now aged</span>

				<span>Such a gift of love and mercy</span>

				<span>Crime has no sex and yet to-day</span>

				<span>Within His love I know there’s room</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I think before His great white throne,</span>

				<span class="i1">His throne of spotless light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That whited sepulchres shall wear</span>

			<p>
				<span>That I who fell, and he who sinned,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>That each the burden of his loss</span>

				<span>Life was trembling, faintly trembling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the bondman’s latest breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he felt the chilling pressure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the cold, hard hand of Death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He had been an Afric chieftain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worn his manhood as a crown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But upon the field of battle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had been fiercely stricken down.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He had longed to gain his freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waited, watched and hoped in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till his life was slowly ebbing⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Almost broken was his chain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By his bedside stood the master,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gazing on the dying one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knowing by the dull grey shadows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That life’s sands were almost run.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Master,” said the dying bondman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Home and friends I soon shall see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But before I reach my country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Master write that I am free;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For the spirits of my fathers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would shrink back from me in pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I told them at our greeting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I a slave had lived and died;⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Give to me the precious token,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That my kindred dead may see⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Master! write it, write it quickly!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Master! write that I am free!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At his earnest plea the master</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrote for him the glad release,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er his wan and wasted features</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flitted one sweet smile of peace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Eagerly he grasped the writing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I am free!” at last he said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Backward fell upon the pillow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was free among the dead.</span>

				<span>This badge of the Loyal Legion</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To wear that badge as a token</span>

				<span>Where sorrow would never reach her</span>

				<span class="i1">Nor harsh words smite her ear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor her eyes in death dimmed slumber</span>

			<p>
				<span>“What means this badge?” said her father,</span>

				<span class="i1">Whom we had tried to save;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who said, when we told her story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Don’t put it in the grave.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We took the badge from her bosom</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And laid it on a chair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And men by drink deluded</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knelt by that badge in prayer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And vowed in that hour of sorrow</span>

				<span>And this little badge became the wedge</span>

			<p>
				<span>And lifted the gloomy shadows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That overspread my life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flooding my home with gladness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made me a happy wife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this is why this scrap of blue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is precious in my sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It changed my sad and gloomy home</span>

				<br/>
				<span>And over the shadows of my life</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stole the light of a peace divine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! then my task was a sacred thing,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>’Twas mine to gather the bruised grain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the “Lord of Paradise.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when the reapers shall lay their grain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the floors of golden light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I feel that mine with its broken sheaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall be precious in His sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though thorns may often pierce my feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the shadows still abide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mists will vanish before His smile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There will be light at eventide.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Jamie’s Puzzle</h2>
			<p>
				<span>There was grief within our household</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because of a vacant chair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our mother, so loved and precious,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No longer was sitting there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our hearts grew heavy with sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our eyes with tears were blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And little Jamie was wondering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why we were left behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We had told our little darling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the land of love and light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the saints all crowned with glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And enrobed in spotless white.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We said that our precious mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had gone to that land so fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dwell with beautiful angels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to be forever there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the child was sorely puzzled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why dear grandmamma should go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dwell in a stranger city,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When her children loved her so.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But again the mystic angel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came with swift and silent tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And our sister, Jamie’s mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was enrolled among the dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To us the mystery deepened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Jamie it seemed more clear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grandma, he said, must be lonesome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mamma has gone to her.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the question lies unanswered</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In our little Jamie’s mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why she should go to our mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And leave her children behind;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To dwell in that lovely city,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From all that was dear to part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From children who loved to nestle</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So closely around her heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dear child, like you, we are puzzled,</span>
				<br/>

				<span>The music flooding all his soul</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To pour upon the air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For this no metal was too rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He counted not the cost;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor deemed the years in which he toiled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As labor vainly lost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When morning flushed with crimson light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The golden gates of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He longed to fill the air with chimes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sweet as a matin’s lay.</span>

			<p>
				<span>And when the sun was sinking low</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within the distant West,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He gladly heard the bells he wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Herald the hour of rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The music of a thousand harps</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could never be so dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As when those solemn chants and thrills</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell on his list’ning ear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He poured his soul into their chimes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And felt his toil repaid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He called them children of his soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His home a’near them made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But evil days came on apace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">War spread his banner wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from his village snatched away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The artist’s love and pride.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At dewy morn and stilly eve</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The chimes no more he heard;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With dull and restless agony</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His spirit’s depths was stirred.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A weary longing filled his soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It bound him like a spell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He left his home to seek the chimes⁠—</span>

				<span class="i1">The chimes he loved so well.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where lofty fanes in grandeur rose,</span>

				<span class="i1">Upon his ear there fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No music like the long lost chimes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his beloved bell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus he wandered year by year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Touched by the hand of time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeking to hear with anxious heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each well remembered chime.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And to that worn and weary heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There came a glad surcease:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He heard again the dear old chimes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And smiled and uttered peace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The chimes! the chimes!” the old man cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I hear their tones at last;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sudden rapture filled his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all his cares were past.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yes, peace had come with death’s sweet calm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His journeying was o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The weary, restless wanderer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had reached the restful shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It may be that he met again,</span>

				<span class="i1">Enfolded in the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dear old chimes beside the gates</span>

				<span class="i1">Where all is bright and fair;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That he who crossed and bowed his head</span>
				<br/>

				<span class="i1">Learned to revel and drink.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Strong drink is a raging demon,</span>

				<span class="i1">At bright and beautiful toys.</span>

				<span class="i1">The love-light in their eyes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I thought of my little Charley</span>

			<p>
				<span>I entered my home a sober man,</span>

				<span class="i1">My heart by remorse was wrung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there in the chimney corner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This little stocking was hung.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Faded and worn as you see it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To me ’tis a precious thing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I never gaze upon it</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But unbidden tears will spring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I began to search my pockets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But scarcely a dime was there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But scanty as was the pittance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This stocking received its share.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For a longing seized upon me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To gladden the heart of my boy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I bought him some cakes and candy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And added a simple toy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then I knelt by this little stocking</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sobbed out an earnest prayer,</span>

			<p>
				<span>And this faded, worn-out stocking,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Became the wedge that broke my chain,</span>

				<span class="i1">And a blessing brought to me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Do you marvel then I prize it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When each darn and seam and hole</span>

				<span>“Pledge me with wine,” the maiden cried,</span>

				<span class="i1">Her tones were gay and light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“From others you have turned aside,</span>

				<span class="i1">I claim your pledge to-night.”</span>

				<span>The blood rushed to the young man’s cheek</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then left it deadly pale;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath the witchery of her smile</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He felt his courage fail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For many years he’d been a slave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the enchanting bowl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until he grasped with eager hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The reins of self-control;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And struggled with his hated thrall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he rent his chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strove to stand erect and free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be a man again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When others came with tempting words</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He coldly turned aside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she who held the sparkling cup</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was his affianced bride;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And like a vision of delight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bright, beautiful and fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thoughtless words she wove for him</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The meshes of despair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From jeweled hands he took the cup,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor heard the serpent’s hiss;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor saw beneath its ruby glow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The deadly adder’s hiss.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Like waves that madly, wildly dash,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When dykes are overthrown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The barriers of his soul gave way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each life with wrecks was strewn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And she who might have reached her hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To succor and to save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon wept in hopeless agony</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above a drunkard’s grave.</span>

				<span>He had plunged into our sorrows,</span>

			<p>
				<span>It was done, the deed of horror;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Christ had died upon the cross,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And within an upper chamber</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The disciples mourned their loss.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Peter’s eyes were full of anguish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thinking sadly of the trial</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When his boasted self-reliance</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ended in his Lord’s denial.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Disappointment, deep and heavy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shrouded every heart with gloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the hopes so fondly cherished</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Died around the garden tomb.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And they thought with shame and sorrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How they fled in that dark hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they saw their Lord and Master</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the clutch of Roman power.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We had hoped, they sadly uttered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would over Israel reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to-day he lies sepulchred.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And our cherished hopes are vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the humble home of Mary</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slowly waned the hours away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till she rose to seek the garden</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the place where Jesus lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not the cross with all its anguish</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could her loving heart restrain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the tomb she sought was empty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her heart o’erflowed with pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To embalm my Lord and Master</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To this garden I have strayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, behold, I miss his body.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I know not where he’s laid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then a wave of strange emotion</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swept her soul, as angels said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wherefore do ye seek the living</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid the chambers of the dead?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Unperceived, her Lord stood by her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Silent witness of her grief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bearing on his lips the tidings</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sure to bring a glad relief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But her tear-dimmed eyes were holden</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When she heard the Master speak;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought she, only ’tis the gardener</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Asking whom her soul did seek.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then a sudden flush of gladness</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’er her grief-worn features spread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she knew the voice of Jesus</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All her bitter anguish fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forth she reached hands in rapture.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Touch me not, the Saviour said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take the message to my brethren,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I have risen from the dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Take them words of joy and comfort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which will all their mourning end;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To their Father and my Father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tell them that I will ascend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Brethren, I have seen the Master:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He is risen from the dead.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But like words of idle meaning</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seemed the glorious words she said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon they saw the revelation</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which would bid their mourning cease;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Christ, the risen, stood before them</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Breathing words of love and peace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Timid men were changed to heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weakness turned to wondrous might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the cross became their standard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Luminous with love and light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From that lonely upper chamber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Holding up the rugged cross,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a glad and bold surrender</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They encountered shame and loss.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In these days of doubt and error,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the conflict for the right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May our hearts be ever strengthened</span>

				<span>Kindly turned to the sinful one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In her sorrow and disgrace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where Simon only saw the stains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where sin and shame were rife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Christ looked beneath and saw the germs</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of a fair, outflowering life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Like one who breaks a galling chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sets a prisoner free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rent her fetters with the words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Thy sins are forgiven thee.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>God be praised for the gracious words</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which came through that woman’s touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That souls redeemed thro’ God’s dear Son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May learn to love him so much;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That souls once red with guilt and crime</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May their crimson stains outgrow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The scarlet spots upon their lives</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Become whiter than driven snow.</span>
